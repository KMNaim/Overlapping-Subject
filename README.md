Project 04 
During Enrollment, sometimes it happens that, student has exceeded the limit of credit. And sometimes a student canâ€™t enroll as the section has already the maximum number of students enrolled. Then manual entry is given. - There should be an option for the teacher to give the manual entry - Student can do the enrollment process as usual - During enrollment, while a student selects a subject, if there is any limit, then message will be shown immediately - This project assumes that the routine is not yet completed - The aim of this project is to find those subjects having no overlapping students - After students request for the subjects, they want to enroll, there will be an option to find out those subjects as following rules: - First show those subjects which have no overlapping student - Then display subjects in ascending order (first show subjects which have minimum overlapping etc.)
